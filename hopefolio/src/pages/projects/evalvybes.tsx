            <p>
              Testing and comparing AI models is typically a technical, tedious
              process. Users need to manually craft prompts, switch between
              platforms, and track results separately - making it difficult to
              find the best AI for their needs.

            <p>
              EvalVybes transforms AI evaluation into a natural conversation.
              Simply speak your tasks, and the platform generates evaluations
              across multiple models, presenting results in an intuitive, visual
              format with real-time comparisons.

              Users start with a pulsing microphone button in brand colors (pink
              #FF4ECC and green #00C09D). They simply speak what they want to do
              with AI - whether it's writing marketing copy, analyzing data, or
              creative tasks.

              As users speak, task cards appear in real-time with smooth
              animations. The system understands natural language commands like
              "I need to write a blog post" or "Let's evaluate this marketing
